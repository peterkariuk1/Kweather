# Kweather

Kweather is a dynamic and responsive weather application built with React and powered by the OpenWeather API. The app allows users to check the weather for various locations, with an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

# Features:
1. Search for Custom Locations: Users can input any location (city) to fetch real-time weather data.

2. Quick Links to Predefined Locations: The app displays weather information for popular cities (e.g., London, Nairobi, Mumbai), updating automatically as quick links are accessed.

3. Dynamic Data Fetching: Fetch weather data based on the user’s input location or by selecting one of the predefined cities.

4. Smooth UI with Fade-in Effects: The app features smooth animations that show and hide elements based on user interactions (e.g., fade-in effect on the instructions section).

5. Real-Time Weather Data: Displays real-time data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions fetched from OpenWeather API.

6.Error Handling: Graceful error handling if the API fails or if an invalid location is entered.

# Technologies Used:
1. React: For building the user interface with efficient component-based architecture.

2. Vite: For a fast development environment and optimized build process.

3. OpenWeather API: For fetching real-time weather data.
 
4. CSS Transitions: For smooth visual transitions, such as fading in and out of UI elements.
   
5. Axios: To handle API requests and responses.
# How It Works:
1. User Input: The user types a city or location in the input field.
  
2. Dynamic Data Fetch: The app fetches weather data dynamically based on the location input and updates the UI with the latest weather information.
 
3. Predefined Locations: The app also has quick links for predefined cities like London, Nairobi, and Mumbai. Clicking on these quick links will immediately display the weather data for these cities.
 
4. Instructions: As the user types, a helpful message appears, guiding them to press 'Enter' to get the weather data.
 
5. Error Handling: If the input is invalid or there’s a problem fetching data, the app displays an error message.
 

# Prerequisites:
Node.js (v14 or higher)
A code editor (e.g., VSCode)
API Key from OpenWeather



# Future Improvements:
1. Geolocation: Allow the app to use the user’s current location to fetch weather data automatically.
 
2. Unit Switching: Allow users to toggle between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).

3. Enhanced Error Handling: Provide more detailed error messages and recovery options in case of network issues or invalid location input.
